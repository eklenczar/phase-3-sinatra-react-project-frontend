To get started run npm install and then npm start.

## The User
I imagined the user for this app to be an employee at The Pie Company taking an order from a customer.

### The App

The Pie Company app works by storing a list of available pies, current customers, and assigning pies to the customers they've been sold to.

### Home
The app has a home page that has updates and reminders for employees that are taking special orders.

### Customers
The customers page allows you to read the current customers, create a new customer using the New Customer button, delete a customer, and edit a customer.

### Pies
The pies page has image cards with a brief description of the pies currently in inventory as well as their price.

### Sell A Pie
This page allows you to select a customer and a pie via dropdown buttons and transfer an available pie to a customer using the Submit button. There is also a list of currently sold pies as well as the id's of the customers who now own them.
